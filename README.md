# Project-Asterorids-
Final Project using 4 principles used in class 

In this project I will create a asteroids game where a ship will shoot asteroids. The game will finish when the starship crash 5 times with asteroids. Pressing the spacebar will give the option to play the game again.The game will keep a record of the score of the player on the right of the screen and keep a record of the lives left. 
Controls for the game:

Up Arrow = UP
Left Arrow = Left
Right Arrow = right
Spacebar = shoot
